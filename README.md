## About The Project
* Criminal Face Recognition System built during the Microsoft Engage 2022. 
* Application of the Facial Recognition Technology. 
* It takes image of an individual as input , and matches the detected face(s) with existing criminals database.
* If detected face(s) is/are matched then information of the criminal(s) can be retrieved else "unknown" will be displayed.

### About Face recognition
Facial recognition is a category of biometric software that maps an individual's facial features mathematically and stores the data as a faceprint. The software uses deep learning algorithms to compare a live capture or digital image to the stored faceprint in order to verify an individual's identity.

### Salient features
* User friendly interface for using the system
* Can detect and recognise multiple faces at same time
* Precise and accurate: Can recognise the person irrespective of age and changed looks.
* Information of recognised criminal can be retrieved from existing database
